# Antithesis Testing

This package supports testing with
[Antithesis](https://antithesis.com/docs/),
a SaaS offering that enables deployment of distributed systems (such
as Avalanche) to a deterministic and simulated environment that
enables discovery and reproduction of anomalous behavior.

See avalanchego's
[documentation](https://github.com/ryt-io/ryt-v2/blob/master/tests/antithesis/README.md)
for more details.
